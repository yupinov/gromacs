@article{spme,
    abstract = {The previously developed particle mesh Ewald method is reformulated in terms of efficient B‐spline interpolation of the structure factors. This reformulation allows a natural extension of the method to potentials of the form 1/r p with p≥1. Furthermore, efficient calculation of the virial tensor follows. Use of B‐splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N {log(N}). For biomolecular systems with many thousands of atoms this method permits the use of Ewald summation at a computational cost comparable to that of a simple truncation method of 10 \AA{} or less.},

It provides a rich set of calculation types, preparation and analysis tools. Several advanced techniques for free-energy calculations are supported. In version 5, it reaches new performance heights, through several new and enhanced parallelization algorithms. These work on every level; \{SIMD\} registers inside cores, multithreading, heterogeneous CPU–GPU acceleration, state-of-the-art 3D domain decomposition, and ensemble-level parallelization through built-in replica exchange and the separate Copernicus framework. The latest best-in-class compressed trajectory storage format is supported. "
